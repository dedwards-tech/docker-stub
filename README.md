# README - `docker-stub`

This is a work in progress.

The intent of this repo is to provide a template for making it simple to build a container,
run your application when the container is launched, then launch the container as necessary.

This template presumes you are creating a CLI style application.  No reason it won't work for
a web app but this is to make it quick and simple to "pull" a copy and modify it for you app.

No need to track changes.
